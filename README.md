##What I find Interesting about the article:

    As a prospective software developer, what's interesting to me is the relevance and value of 
the article itself. Though short, the article beautifully summarizes of the top 5 things
that make a good developer. It's comparable to some religious text, a guiding manual.
Perhaps my favorite section is about the problem decomposition - thinking through and 
breaking down a complex problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until each one can be
solved easily. An interesting indication of poorly thought out code, is when it's hard to
follow and somebody else has trouble understanding what's going on; this made me reflect
on all my spaghetti code, and how horrendous my problem solving skills were.
